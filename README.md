# NBA Database Information Retrieval System

## Project Description

The project is primarily aimed at developing an end-to-end application and to demonstrate standard software development principles. We have chosen the popular NBA-Statistics API to setup our database. Our architecture is a combination of the popular MVC design pattern and Client-Server (Layered) architecture taught in class. Upon launching the application, the user is greeted with a homepage and can move forward to query about player, team statistics setup in our database. We have used Python, HTML, CSS & SQLlite3 for our development.
